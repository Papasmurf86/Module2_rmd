## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.


```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

```

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        
> This is a block quote

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure 2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
